Social media has allowed celebrities to directly communicate with fans over the years. Nowadays Twitter is the most influential platform used by celebrities. Data Scientists also increase their interest in the impact of social media and celebrities on people. For this purpose Tweepy, Twitter API, etc are very useful to track account of particular celebrity but for this Twitter handle (e.g. @realDonaldTrump for Donald Trump) is required. 

However, there is no proper method available to fetch twitter handle by using just a normal name. I tried to conceptualize a data scrapping method to fetch a twitter handle for celebrities. Aim of this project was to get handles for famous celebratries using web scraping techqniues from google and then use Tweety API and Instagram API to fetch revalent statistics.
